# Future Enhancements

This section outlines strategic next steps and expansion areas identified to elevate the current IGLM Identity and Access Management (IAM) system to production-grade maturity.

---

## Key Areas for Future Development

### 1. Complete Adapter Implementations
- Develop detailed connector logic for all supported target application types within the placeholder adapter files.
- Target systems include:
  - LDAP
  - Various relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle)
  - RESTful APIs
  - SOAP services
  - Command-line interface (CMD) integrations

### 2. Implement Missing Helpers
- Finalize utility modules such as:
  - `commandOutputParser.js`
  - Other auxiliary parsers, mappers, or transformers needed for robust operation.

### 3. Refine Reconciliation Logic
- Introduce advanced remediation policies:
  - **Auto-Remediation:** Immediate automated corrections.
  - **Manual Review:** Flagging discrepancies for human validation.
- Enhance the linkage of remediation task IDs to specific discrepancies for traceability.
- Improve discrepancy reporting granularity for better operational oversight.

### 4. Implement Frontend (Phase 6)
- Develop a web-based administrative interface.
- Potentially include self-service portals for end-users to manage access requests.
- Features to include dashboards, access reports, remediation actions, and manual overrides.

### 5. Advanced Features (Phase 7)
- Introduce sophisticated IAM functionalities such as:
  - **Access Reviews** (Periodic certifications of user access)
  - **Separation of Duties (SoD)** enforcement
  - **Access Request Workflows** with approvals
  - **Bulk Operations** (e.g., mass onboarding, terminations)
  - **Comprehensive Auditing** (full activity trails)
  - **Scheduled Reports** for governance and compliance reporting

### 6. Dockerization & Deployment (Phase 8)
- Finalize production-grade Dockerfiles for all microservices.
- Develop deployment blueprints:
  - Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets)
  - Helm charts
  - GitOps or CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.

### 7. Health Check Enhancements
- Embed active health checks within services to verify:
  - Database connection health.
  - Message Queue connectivity.
  - External system accessibility (ping endpoints, validate API/DB credentials).
- Surface service-level health status through `/healthz` endpoints and integrate into monitoring dashboards.

## Conclusion

The current architecture lays a robust foundation. These future enhancements will systematically elevate the platform towards a highly scalable, secure, and enterprise-ready IAM solution.
