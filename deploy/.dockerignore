# --- Explicitly include directories that might be excluded by default .gitignore rules ---
# If your .gitignore excludes folders without explicit negations, you might need to negate here
#!/services/ # Example negation if /services was excluded
#!/shared/   # Example negation if /shared was excluded

# If using nested package.json and npm ci, ensure package-lock.json files are included
# COPY instructions already specify exact paths, so this might not be needed, but can help context transfer
